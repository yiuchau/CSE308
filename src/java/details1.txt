A lesbian mother fights for custody of her child. A transsexual pilot is fired by a commercial airline after undergoing sex change and sues for sexual discrimination. A homosexual is denied employment because of sexual orientation. The law has much to say about sexual behaviour, but what it says is rarely influenced by the findings of social science research.

Reflecting the author's wide experience as a respected sex researcher, expert witness, and lawyer, Sexual Science and the Law provides insights into some of the most controversial social and sexual topics.	http://books.google.com/books?id=pPkRHairg3UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780674802681&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api
